I'm a part time hobbiest compiler dev, currently working on [Khasm](https://gitlab.com/jake-87/khasm-lang)

I speak english, and am learning toki pona.

I mostly program in C, but I have been known to do some nodejs, python and fortran.

I do a bit of computer science on the side, and am currently in the process of attempting to get a paper published.
