I'm a part time hobbiest compiler dev, currently working on [Khasm](https://gitlab.com/jake-87/khasm-lang)

I speak english, and am learning toki pona.

I mostly program in C, but I have been known to do some nodejs, python and fortran.

I am not part of the FreeBSD Foundation in any way. This is a bad email choice from a long while ago; I am currently working on fixing that mistake.
